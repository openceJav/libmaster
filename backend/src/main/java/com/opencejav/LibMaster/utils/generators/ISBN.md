## Introduction

ISBNs are unique identifiers for books, they are used to identify books and help in 
managing the inventory of books. 
- ISBN stands for International Standard Book Number.
- ISBNs are unique and are used to identify books by publishers, booksellers, libraries, and internet retailers.
- Generating an ISBN is a complex process and requires somewhat of a deep understanding of the ISBN standards.

## ISBN-10 vs ISBN-13

In 2007, the ISBN system was updated to a more modern 13-digit format to accommodate 
for the growing number of publications and the need for more unique identifiers. While
ISBN-10 is still relatively common among many countries, it is being phased out in favor
for the newer ISBN-13 format, which provides more options for identification for
many publishers.


### How Do I Look up an ISBN Number?

An ISBN (Internation Standard Book Number) lookup can be done through the following:
1. **Online Database**
2. **Library Catalog**
3. **BookSellers**
4. **Smartphone Apps**

Each of these methods can be used to look up an ISBN for a book, however since we
are developing a library management system, we will be using `ISBN-13` as the standard
and will be generating ISBN-13 numbers for our books, as this is the growing standard.

**NOTE**: We will also need to provide ISBN lookup functionality and filtering for our
own library management system using the ISBN-13 standard.
