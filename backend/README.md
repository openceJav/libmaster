## Introduction 

LibMaster Library Management System is a Library Management System designed from the ground up
to be simple, easy-to-use, and efficient with querying and filtering. This portion of the project
is the RESTful API that will act as the middleware for the front-end and the database. The API
is built using the following technologies:
1. `Java - JDK 17`
2. `Spring Boot - (Latest Version`)
3. `MongoDB Connector - (Latest Version`)
4. `Swagger - (Latest Version)`
5. `Lombok - (Latest Version)`
6. `JUnit - (Latest Version)`
7. `Docker - (Latest Version)`

Although the project is following a more monolithic approach, it is designed to be modular and
scalable. The project can be easily converted into a service following the microservice architectural 
approach but for the time being it will remain as a monolithic project.
