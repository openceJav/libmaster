# These owners will be the default owners for everything
# within the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# they will be requested for review when someone opens a
# PR (pull request).

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes
# the most precedence. When someone opens a PR that only
# modifies .yml files, only the following people and NOT
# the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
