# Security Policy

If you have recently discovered a security issue, please report it to use 
and bring it to our attention right away!

## 🛡️ Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue to report a security vulnerability. It would be
wiser to contact us or any maintainer directly via email or other private means. This 
will help ensure that any vulnerabilities are addressed and resolved as quickly as possible.

## 🔑 Supported Versions

Project versions that are currently being supported with security updated vary per project. Please
see specific project repositories for details. If nothing is specified, consider only the latest
version or major versions to be supported.
